	<strong><h3>WEB DESIGN</h3></strong>
	<p>In Fall 2017 I participated in the HTML/CSS course taught by Barnard's <a href="http://athenadigitaldesign.org/">Athena Digital Design Agency</a>. Through the Agency I gained the tools to build this site. Here are some of the websites I admire, as well as resources that've helped me shape my own.</p>
